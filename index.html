                    <p>Hi, I'm Mibom Perme, a first year undergraduate pursuing B.Tech at Veer Surendra Sai University of Technology, Burla.
                            I have a keen interest in programming and I have little experience in C language and currently delving into C++ as well. 
                            I am currently exploring the fields of cybersecurity and competitive programming, and I am eager to learn more about open source 
                            and other technologies. I love problem solving and new challenges to improve myself, and also collaborating with others who share similar passions.
                            
                            <p>If I have to give a short description about myself, I'll say I am the character "Chandler Bing" from the show "FRIENDS".</p>

                    <p>I like sketching from time to time, wether on a notebook or the notepad that comes with my phone, 
                        while I picked up coding as a hobby, I discovered a similarity in bringing my ideas to life with precision and innovation as my sketches. 
                        I find the idea of a sentient software thrilling and am excited to discover it's various ways of working and other innovations throughout
                        the vast realm of technology.</p>
